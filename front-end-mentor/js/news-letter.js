// üìùBrief
// Your challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
//
//     You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
//
//     Your users should be able to:
//
// 1. Add their email and submit the form
// 2. See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
// 3. See form validation messages if:
// 4. The field is left empty
// 5. The email address is not formatted correctly
// 6. View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
// 7. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
// 8. Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
